# User-Centered Design

User-Centered Design (UCD) is an iterative design process that focuses on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process.

## Key Principles:
- Understand the user's needs and context
- Involve users throughout the design process
- Use usability testing to refine solutions
- Deliver solutions that are usable and satisfying

UCD ensures that products are usable, accessible, and enjoyable for their target users.
