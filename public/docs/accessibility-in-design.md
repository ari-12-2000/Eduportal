# Accessibility in Design

Accessibility in design ensures that products can be used by people with a wide range of abilities and disabilities.

## Key Concepts:
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Ensure color contrast for readability
- Design for keyboard and screen reader navigation
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content

Accessibility is not a feature, it's a necessity. Inclusive design benefits everyone.
