# Design Thinking Process

Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to problem-solving and innovation.

## Phases:
1. **Empathize** – Understand the user's needs
2. **Define** – Frame the problem clearly
3. **Ideate** – Generate a wide range of ideas
4. **Prototype** – Create quick and low-fidelity versions
5. **Test** – Validate with users and iterate

This process helps teams build creative, user-first solutions.
